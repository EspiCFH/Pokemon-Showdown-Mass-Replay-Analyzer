# Pokemon-Showdown-Mass-Replay-Analyzer
A tool designed to analyze multiple replays at once, making data analysis much easier.
# You like poorly optimized codes with likely undiscovered bugs!? me too! that's what this is.
I have not ironed out every edge case so there's a high likelyhood that this runs into errors down the line that will have to be patched.
But for now, this version works for 99% of cases.
-# please note, this program does not understand how Zoroark works, due to the nature of Pokemon Showdown replay logs.

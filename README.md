# Pok√©mon Showdown Mass Replay Analyzer
I have not ironed out every edge case so there's a high likelyhood that this runs into errors down the line that will have to be patched.  
###### note: this program does not understand how Zoroark works, due to the nature of Pokemon Showdown replay logs.
###### second note: as of the most recent version (1.4), this program will likely not work for VGC. this is due to the program's heavy use of deductive reasoning with the nature of single battles.

# To Use:
When you open the program, you will be prompted between two options, **Single Replay**, and **Multiple**.  
**Single Replay** lets you submit and analyze 1 replay.  
**Multiple** will read all the replays within the **replays.txt** file that comes with the release. (It will analyze those in whichever order given.)  
To see the result of the analysis, check the **output.txt** file.  
  
###### If it doesnt seem like every replay is being analyzed, please send me a DM on Discord with the replay in question and I will try to help you to the best of my ability. My discord is EspiCFH, just like my GitHub
